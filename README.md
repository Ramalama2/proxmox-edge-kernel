# Thanks for Fabian's work in the days of PVE 7!
Since we will Stuck on Kernel 6.8 for a long Time, because 6.8 is LTS, i need to continue his Project.<br>
At the moment, there is nothing, so don't try to Compile anything from here. It's in Work!

# Proxmox Edge kernels
Custom Linux kernels for Proxmox VE 8.

#### Available Versions
1. Linux 6.9

### Manual
Alternatively, you may manually install the kernels.<br>
-- IN WORK, there will be a simple update script, because i won't provide any Repository!

## Building manually
You may also choose to manually build one of these kernels yourself.<br>
-- IN WORK, there will be a simple script for this either!

## Removal
Use `apt` to remove individual kernel packages from your system. If you want
to remove all packages from a particular kernel release, use the following
command:

```bash
apt remove proxmox-kernel-6*edge proxmox-headers-6*edge
```

## Contributing

Im primary doing this for myself, but everyone is free to use it.<br>
In Case you absolutely have to, i leave the "issues" Secion activated, but if i get overwhelmed, i will disable it!
